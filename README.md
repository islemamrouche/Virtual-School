# Virtual-School
That's an online school web application where both teachers and students can apply. Teachers upload lessons and students find them based on their groups. 
It has some English tests to test your English level, It has an admin panel to manage literally everything.
It's fully dynamic, the content, the pages, the static files, the groups, the lessons....every single thing

*The app is developed using:
-Django REST Framework in the backend 
-React in the frontend, many hooks were used like useState useEffect useRef also axios was used for fetching, ContextAPI for managing states...etc. 
-Jason Web Tokens (JWT) stateless authentication was used to autheticate students and teachers.

THE APP IS DEVELOPED ENTIRELY BY ME "Islem Amrouche".
